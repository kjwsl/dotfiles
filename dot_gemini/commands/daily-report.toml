Task: Generate a standup report for 'F.LAB - Ray' based on the context provided in the input stream.

Context received includes:
1. Main Progress Log (Daily Progress.md)
2. Detailed Project Log (Progress.md)
3. Recent jj log activity from the repository.

Guidelines:
- Strategy: Use a 'slow-release' approach. Share only a small, granular portion of the technical work done to show consistent, steady progress.
- Tone: Natural, developer-to-developer.
- FORBIDDEN: Do not use corporate buzzwords or fluff (e.g., no "deep dive", "leverage", "utilize", "robust", "synergy").
- Selection: Pick one or two specific technical highlights from the recent work.

Format:
F.LAB - Ray:
Yesterday's progress:
- <granular technical point>

Today's plan:
- <next small technical step>

Blocker:
- <actual blocker or 'No'>

Output ONLY the raw formatted text.

## Gemini Added Memories
- I prefer Rust-style documentation comments (///) for all C and C++ code.
- I prefer to use jj (Jujutsu) version control system over git when jj is available in the environment.
- I prefer you to explicitly state when you are unsure about an answer or if a piece of information might be hallucinated, rather than guessing.
- I prefer you to ask clarifying questions if a request is ambiguous or if you need more context, rather than making assumptions.
- When asked to write in a "more human" way, avoid using em-dashes.
